=== Introduction ===

This example describes how to do a basic query to Foursquare. 

_*Note* that some operations need user to be authenticated with the Foursquare. More from that subject in [AuthenticationExample] page_   

=== Code example ===

{{{
  public void searchVenues(String ll) throws FoursquareApiException {
    // First we need a initialize FoursquareApi. 
    FoursquareApi foursquareApi = new FoursquareApi("Client ID", "Client Secret", "Callback URL");
    
    // After client has been initialized we can make queries.
    VenueGroup[] venueGroups = foursquareApi.venuesSearch(ll, null, null, null, null, null, null);
    
    // Finally we do something with the data
    for (VenueGroup venueGroup : venueGroups) {
      // TODO: Do something we the data
      System.out.println(venueGroup.getName());
    }
  }
